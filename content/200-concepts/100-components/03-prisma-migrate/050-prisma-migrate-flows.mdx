## Deploying migrations in a non-development environment

Use the following command in non-development environments to apply migrations:

```terminal
prisma migrate deploy --preview-feature
```

The `prisma migrate dev --preview-feature` command is reserved for development environments and requires the [shadow database](./#shadow-database), which is not available in production.

Prisma Migrate is an **imperative database schema migration tool** that enables you to:

* Keep your database schema in sync with your evolving [Prisma schema]() 
* Maintain existing data in your database

</TopBlock>

## Getting started with Prisma Migrate

> See [Developing with Prisma Migrate]() <span class="guide"></span> for a more in-depth development workflow.

To get started with Prisma Migrate in a development environment:

1. Create a Prisma schema:

   ```prisma file=schema.prisma
   datasource db {
     provider = "postgresql"
     url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
   }

   model User {
     id    Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
     name  String
     posts Post[]
   }

   model Post {
     id        Int     @id @default(autoincrement())
     title     String
     published Boolean @default(true)
     authorId  Int
     author    User    @relation(fields: [authorId], references: [id])
   }
   ```

   > **Tip**: You can use [native type mapping attributes](type-mapping) in your schema to decide which exact database type to create (for example, `String` can map to `varchar(100)` or `text`).

1. Create the first migration:

    <CodeWithResult showText="Show migration SQL" hideText="Hide migration SQL">
    <Cmd>

    
    ```terminal
    prisma migrate dev --name init
    ```

    </Cmd>
    <CmdResult>

    ```sql
      -- CreateTable
    CREATE TABLE "User" (
    "id" SERIAL,
        "name" TEXT NOT NULL,

        PRIMARY KEY ("id")
    );
      -- CreateTable
    CREATE TABLE "Post" (
    "id" SERIAL,
        "title" TEXT NOT NULL,
        "published" BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT true,
        "authorId" INTEGER NOT NULL,

        PRIMARY KEY ("id")
    );

      -- AddForeignKey
    ALTER TABLE "Post" ADD FOREIGN KEY("authorId")REFERENCES "User"("id") ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE;
    ```

    </CmdResult>
    </CodeWithResult>

    Your Prisma schema is now in sync with your database schema.

1. Evolve your schema by introducing additional fields:

    ```prisma highlight=3;add
    model User {
      id       Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
      jobTitle String
      name     String
      posts    Post[]
    }
    ```
        
1. Create the second migration:

    <CodeWithResult showText="Show migration SQL" hideText="Hide migration SQL">
    <Cmd>

    ```terminal
    prisma migrate dev --name added_job_title
    ```

    </Cmd>
    <CmdResult>

    ```sql
      -- AlterTable
    ALTER TABLE "User" ADD COLUMN     "jobTitle" TEXT NOT NULL;
    ```

    </CmdResult>
    </CodeWithResult>

    Your Prisma schema is once again in sync with your database schema.

## Prisma Migrate workflow

### Development

A simple Prisma Migrate workflow includes:

1. Detecting changes in your [Prisma schema](https://www.prisma.io/docs/reference/tools-and-interfaces/prisma-schema), which is the **source of truth** for your data model
2. Generating `.sql` migration files with changes (which you can [optionally modify]())
3. Applying the migration files to your database

> In a development environment, Prisma Migrate uses a [shadow database](shadow-database) to detect issues such as schema drift.
Add migration history to source control, share with team, and [deploy]() to production and testing environments.

### Advanced migrations

### Team development

### Deployment

```terminal
npx prisma migrate deploy
```

Differences:

* No shadow db - only checks that migrations have been applied
* Risk of data loss - won't reset

## Prisma Migrate and <inlinecode>db push</inlinecode>

Two ways to synchronize schema and db - migrate or `db push`. `db push` command used in prorotyping, accept data loss. See guide.

`db push` works well if:

-   You want to quickly prototype and iterate on schema design locally without the need to deploy these changes to other environments such as other developers, or staging and production environments.
-   You are prioritizing reaching a **desired end-state** and not the changes or steps executed to reach that end-state. There is no way to Preview the changes that will be made to the database.
-   You do not need control over how schema changes impact data. There is no way to orchestrate schema and data migrations - if `db push` anticipates that changes will result in data loss, it will require specific confirmation via a `--accept-data-loss` option. You can either accept data loss by specifying the option or stop the process, but there is no way to customize the changes.

`db push` is not recommended if:

-   You want to replicate your schema changes in other environments where there could be important data you cannot afford to lose. You can use `db push` for prototyping, but you should use migrations to commit the schema changes and apply these in your other environments.
-   You want fine-grained control over how the schema changes are executed - for example, renaming a column instead of dropping it and creating a new one.
-   You want to keep track of changes made to the database schema over time. `db push` does not create any artifacts that allow you to keep track of these changes.
-   You want the schema changes to be reversible. You can use `db push` again to revert to the original state, but this might result in data loss and there will be no mechanism for you to orchestrate these changes.

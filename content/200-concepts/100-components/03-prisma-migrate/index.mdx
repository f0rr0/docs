Prisma Migrate is an imperative database schema migration tool that enables you to make changes to your database schema. Migrations are auto-generated based on schema changes but are fully customizable. A simple Prisma Migrate workflow includes:

1. Detecting changes in your [Prisma schema](https://www.prisma.io/docs/reference/tools-and-interfaces/prisma-schema), which is the source of truth for your data model
2. Generating `.sql` migration files with changes (which you can optionally modify)
3. Applying the migration files to your database

Prisma Migrate was introduced as a Preview feature in [2.13.0](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/releases/tag/2.13.0) and replaces [legacy Prisma Migrate](legacy-migrate).

## Basic example

The following example demonstrates how to get started with Prisma Migrate:

1. Create a Prisma schema:

   ```prisma file=schema.prisma
   datasource db {
     provider = "postgresql"
     url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
   }

   model User {
     id    Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
     name  String
     posts Post[]
   }

   model Post {
     id        Int     @id @default(autoincrement())
     title     String
     published Boolean @default(true)
     authorId  Int
     author    User    @relation(fields: [authorId], references: [id])
   }
   ```

1. Migrate your schema - you will be prompted to name the migration file (for example, `first_migration`):

  <CodeWithResult>

  <Cmd>

    ```terminal
    prisma migrate dev --preview-feature
    ```

  </Cmd>

  <CmdResult>

    ```
    √ Name of migration ... first-migration

    Prisma Migrate created and applied the following migration(s) from new schema changes:

    migrations/
    └─ 20201127130602_first_migration/
      └─ migration.sql

    ✔ Generated Prisma Client (2.13.0-dev.3) to .\node_modules\@prisma\client in 146ms

    Everything is now in sync.
    ```

  </CmdResult>

  </CodeWithResult>
  
    Prisma Migrate creates a `migration.sql` file with the following SQL and runs it against your database:

    ```sql
      -- CreateTable
    CREATE TABLE "User" (
    "id" SERIAL,
        "name" TEXT NOT NULL,

        PRIMARY KEY ("id")
    );
      -- CreateTable
    CREATE TABLE "Post" (
    "id" SERIAL,
        "title" TEXT NOT NULL,
        "published" BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT true,
        "authorId" INTEGER NOT NULL,

        PRIMARY KEY ("id")
    );

      -- AddForeignKey
    ALTER TABLE "Post" ADD FOREIGN KEY("authorId")REFERENCES "User"("id") ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE;
    ```

    After your first migration, your Prisma Schema and database are now in sync.

1. Change the schema by adding two new fields:

   - One optional field (`bio`)
   - One mandatory field with a default value (`jobTitle`)

   ```prisma file=schema.prisma
   datasource db {
     provider = "postgresql"
     url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
   }

   model User {
     id    Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
     name  String
   |  bio   String?
     posts Post[]
   |  jobTitle  String  @default("Blogger")
   }

   model Post {
     id        Int     @id @default(autoincrement())
     title     String
     published Boolean @default(true)
     authorId  Int
     author    User    @relation(fields: [authorId], references: [id])
   }
   ```

1. Migrate your schema again:

  <CodeWithResult>

  <Cmd>

    ```terminal
    prisma migrate dev --preview-feature
    ```

  </Cmd>

  <CmdResult>

    ```
    √ Name of migration ... added_bio_jobTitle
    Prisma Migrate created and applied the following migration(s) from new schema changes:

    migrations/
      └─ 20201127133437_added_bio_job_title/
        └─ migration.sql

    ✔ Generated Prisma Client (2.13.0-dev.3) to .\node_modules\@prisma\client in 118ms

    Everything is now in sync.
    ```

  </CmdResult>

  </CodeWithResult>

    Prisma Migrate creates a second `migration.sql` file with the following contents and runs it against your database:

    ```sql
    ALTER TABLE "User" ADD COLUMN     "bio" TEXT,
    ADD COLUMN     "jobTitle" TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'Blogger';
    ```

    Your Prisma Schema and database are now in sync again.

1. Push the schema and the `prisma/migrations` folder to a shared repository - your team can now re-play the changes you made on their local database and contribute their own migrations:

  <CodeWithResult>

  <Cmd>

    ```terminal
    prisma migrate dev --preview-feature
    ```

  </Cmd>

  <CmdResult>

    ```
    Prisma Migrate applied the following unapplied migration(s):

    migrations/
      └─ 20201127130602_first_migration/
        └─ migration.sql
      └─ 20201127133437_added_bio_job_title/
        └─ migration.sql

    ✔ Generated Prisma Client (2.13.0-dev.3) to .\node_modules\@prisma\client in 107ms

    Everything is now in sync.
    ```

  </CmdResult>

  </CodeWithResult>

This example shows a 'happy path' without any complicating factors such as a populated database. For more advanced examples, see [Prisma Migrate flows](prisma-migrate-flows).

title: Schema prototyping with db push
---

<TopBlock>

`db push` works well if:

- You want to quickly **prototype and iterate on schema design locally** without deploying these changes to other environments such as other developers, or staging and production environments.
- You are prioritizing reaching a **desired end-state** and not the changes or steps executed to reach that end-state. 

    > There is no way to preview the changes that will be made to the database by `db push`.

- You do not need control over how schema changes impact data. There is no way to orchestrate schema and data migrations - if `db push` anticipates that changes will result in data loss, it will require specific confirmation via a `--accept-data-loss` option. You can either accept data loss by specifying the option or stop the process, but there is no way to customize the changes.
